Requirements for Assignment 4.1: Mood Detection
-----------------------------

## **Steps Taken for this Activity**
1. Using a python file in which it will capture the faces of different moods, it will create number of images that will use as the data to train for the model to learn and detect faces. 
See the image below:

2. Each moods has its own folder in order to have labels wherein the model can use to based in recognizing these moods.
3. Using the codes of the last Hands-On Activity, recognizing these different moods are possible.
4. To recognize whether it is my face or not, I used the confidence level (param[1]) in order to determine if the face in front of the camera is detectable or not and if it matches the data inserted. Through this, if the confidence level would be less than 80, it will display the label included in the list of names otherwise, it will display "unknown".
5. Running the code would be able to determine if the parameters inserted are working.
6. See the images below for the results

## **Conclusion:**
In this activity, we were challenged to use our knowledge when it comes to applying the concepts of computer vision. This field of technology is still improving and finding possible areas where it can be applied and solve a certain problem. Just like machine learning, this concept of technology also depends on data which indicated that data is an important factor in terms of creating automation machines or intellectual machines that are systemized or programmed to do a certain task. This activity shows how a code would be able to determine the mood of a person depending on its facial expressions. Through adding some data, the model used would be able to recognize the needed moods for this activity. Also, using the confidence level (param[1]) of the model, this would be the condition in order to determine if the person in front of the camera is the creator (me) or just random objects or person detected. If this param would not meet the condition it will display "unknown", stating that it is not the face of the creator (me) that was detected and recognized. All in all, this activity is challenging one since we should be able to detect both the mood and face (own's face) which means that modification is needed. But I still manage to do it and provide results which satisfied the needed requirements for this assignment.
